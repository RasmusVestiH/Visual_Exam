# Visual Analytics - Assignment 3: Edge Detection

## Description
**Disclaimer: This assignment has been worked out in the group consisting of Emil Buus Thomsen, Christoffer Kramer and Rasmus Vesti Hansen**
In this assignment we were working with manipulation of an image and edge detection with the purpose of sorting letters from a memorial artwork. The primary image was of Jefferson Memorial, in which we were to outline the text and crop the image with the final product of detecting the edges for letters. 
For this assignment we managed to make our scripts run in the terminal through a bash script that creates the virtual environment and takes care of saving the output. 


## Running it
This means that you will have to run a terminal and git clone this repository and afterwards setting the directory to assignment3. 
In the terminal you can just run the bash_script run_script and it should work. 
Then it should have the rectangular drawn, cropped and letter images in the output folder.
