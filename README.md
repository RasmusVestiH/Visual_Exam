# Visual_Exam

## Instructions
Welcome to this repository in which I have uploaded my submissions for the portfolio exam in Visual Analytics. The structure for each assignment is the same. For a quick run a bash script named run_script.sh in each assignment has been made which will take care of setting up a virtual environment and downloading necessary packages for the scripts. Alongside this all data will be downloaded through the bash script as well as creating output files. Some scripts will however have altered datasets that I have created based on smaller random samples to ensure the possiblities to upload on Github and an easy reproduceability (Assignment 5). 
With each assignment follows a readme with an explanation of the process for each assignment.
